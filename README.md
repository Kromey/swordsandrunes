# Swords and Runes

Each year, [r/roguelikedev] does an event where members follow along with the [Complete Roguelike Tutorial] and make a simple roguelike game.

Each year, I look at the event and think, "Hey, that would be fun! Maybe next year I won't have other projects and can join in."

This year, I told those other projects, "Hey! Screw you! I'm doing this thing now!"

While I'm generally following the tutorial's steps, rather than using its Python+libtcod I'm using Rust with the Bevy game engine. This is
my third game to use Bevy, but the first that's turn-based, so that should be interesting!

Sprites (for now at least) are from [DCSS].
